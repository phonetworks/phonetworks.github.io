     *
     * If the continueCallBack is specified, this callback will be called every
     * time before the next event handler is called.
     *
     * If the continueCallback returns false, event propagation stops. This
     * allows you to use the eventEmitter as a means for listeners to implement
     * functionality in your application, and break the event loop as soon as
     * some condition is fulfilled.
     *
     * Note that returning false from an event subscriber breaks propagation
     * and returns false, but if the continue-callback stops propagation, this
     * is still considered a 'successful' operation and returns true.
     *
     * Lastly, if there are 5 event handlers for an event. The continueCallback
     * will be called at most 4 times.
